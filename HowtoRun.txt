## TO TEST THE AGENT USING PRE-TRAINED WEIGHTS ##

To test the agent using trained weights, run the following commands in different terminals (parallelly).

"Terminal 1:"
    roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

"Terminal 2:"
    roslaunch ddqn ddqn_test.launch

"Terminal 3: (Optional: This is to gun the gazebo GUI)"
    gzclient



## TO TRAIN THE AGENT ##

"Terminal 1:"
    roslaunch turtlebot_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch

"Terminal 2:"
    roslaunch ddqn ddqn_train.launch

"Terminal 3: (Optional: This is to run the gazebo GUI)"
    gzclient


## CONFIGURING THE AGENT SETTINGS ##
Navigate to settings.py from ws_tb2_rl_simulation/src/ddqn/config directory.
settings.py file can be used to configure required settings.


## TO PLOT THE GRAPHS ##
Open ws_tb2_rl_simulation/src/ddqn/scripts/agent directory in terminals
run the plot_xxxxxx.py files: 

    plot_td_error.py  - to plot average td error vs episodes
    plot_rewards.py   - to plot rewards vs episodes
    plot_hyperparameter_gamma.py - to plot the hyperparameter(gamma) values tuned
